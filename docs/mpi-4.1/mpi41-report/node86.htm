Partitioned communication extends persistent point-to-point communication as  defined in  
Chapter <a href="node53.htm#Node53">Point-to-Point Communication</a>. Partitioned communication operations are matched based on the order in which the local initialization calls are performed. Partitioned  
communication is ``partitioned'' because it allows for multiple contributions of  
data to be made, potentially, from multiple actors (e.g., threads or tasks) in an <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> process to a single communication  
operation.  
<P> 
 
<br> 
<em> Advice to users.</em>  
<P> 
The techniques of partitioned communication were known as ``finepoints''   
before their adoption into the <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> standard.   
We refer the interested reader to the original literature describing the  
design goals, functioning, initial implementation   
and performance improvements [<a href="node600.htm#-Bib29">29</a>,<a href="node600.htm#-Bib30">30</a>].  
 (<em> End of advice to users.</em>) <br> 
Partitioned communication operations use  
a persistent communication style that involves a sequence of start and test or wait operations. For this  
sequence, partitioned communications use <font face="sans-serif"> MPI_START</font> or <font face="sans-serif"> MPI_STARTALL</font> calls  
and completion mechanisms (e.g., <font face="sans-serif"> MPI_TEST</font> or <font face="sans-serif"> MPI_WAIT</font>).  
Partitioned communication is different in three fundamental ways from persistent  
point-to-point operations in <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font>.   
First, partitioned communication  
allows additional partitioned test function calls that can expose partial completion  
of the operation.  
Second, partitioned communication may perform all  
of the initialization required to enable data transfer as  
early as its initialization phase. Third, partitioned communication allows for  
<font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> to be independently notified of multiple contributions from the   
send-side to a single data buffer of a single <font face="sans-serif"> MPI</font> message.  
<P> 
 
<br> 
<em> Rationale.</em>  
<P> 
The rationale behind having different initialization behavior allowed for  
partitioned communication as opposed to persistent point-to-point communication is to  
enable flexibility and optimization possibilities in implementations.  
Buffer setup can occur in the  
partitioned communication initialization functions (see Section <a href="node88.htm#Node88">Communication Initialization and Starting with Partitioning</a>).   
However, such negotiation can be deferred until  
data is to be moved between two processes. This means that partitioned communication can  
lazily negotiate as late as testing for completion of the operation on the first  
iteration of a sequence of partitioned communication start and test or wait operations.  
Matching still occurs as if matching happened at the partitioned communication initialization functions  
as noted in the function descriptions.  
 (<em> End of rationale.</em>) <br>
