<h3><a name=hotel>Hotels</a></h3>

<p>
For this meeting, no dedicated hotel block has been reserved. However, RIKEN visitors can get special rates (which may be lower than internet rates, but do not have to) at various hotels. These hotels are listed <a href="http://www.sys.aics.riken.jp/Kobe-Hotels.html">on this map (NEW!)</a>.
</p>
<p>
Two other hotel choices have been suggested:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theb-hotels.com/the-b-kobe/en/">The B-Hotel Kobe</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.daiwaroynet.jp/english/kobesannomiya/">Daiwa Roynet
Hotel Kobe Sannomiya</a></li>
</ul>
</P>
<p>
However, other choices may exist. Here are some general tips from our host Atsushi Hori: "Sannomiya (mainland) is the busiest part of Kobe, lots of restaurants, shops, and many places to see. RIKEN AICS is located in an artificial island, there is nothing but buildings. Definitely, Sannomiya is much more fun to stay."
