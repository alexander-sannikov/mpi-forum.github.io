<h3>Status:</h3>

<P>
The standardization of MPI 3.1 is complete and the new version of the standard is available at <a href="http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/docs.html">MPI Forum Document Page</A>.
</P>

<h2>Scope:</h2>

<p>Provide small additions to MPI 3.0 and integrate them together with identified errata items into a new version of the MPI standard.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>
The information below reflects the state of the MPI 3.1 efforts up to the ratification on June 4th 2015. It is no longer maintained, but kept for historical reasons.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Timeline:</h2>
<p>
As of the December 2014 meeting, we completed all additions to the MPI 3.1 standard and the expectation was that we vote on the standard at the March 2015 meeting. However, due to technical issues found, this was postponed and is now scheduled for the June 2015 meeting. Here is the timeline for this process:
<ul>
<li>Starting Dec. 2014: Start integrating passed tickets into golden copy</li>
<ul><li>Has to be done by chapter committee chairs</li>
<li>Changes to be reviewed by chapter committees</li>
<li>Text edits must follow <a href="http://meetings.mpi-forum.org/2014-12-instructions.pdf">http://meetings.mpi-forum.org/2014-12-instructions.pdf</a>
<li>The location of the SVN repo listed in the instructions</li>
<li>WARNING: start with current version of the golden copy (Fortran changes already in)</li>
</ul>
<li>By February 2nd (4 weeks before MPI Forum)</li>
<ul><li>Chapter committee chairs publish draft of each chapter</li>
<li>Commit to golden copy for MPI 3.1 in the repo</li>
<li>Some kind of diff with old chapter (what ever works for the chapter)</li>
<li>To be sent to MPI forum email list</li>
<li>Full draft will be on the forum page for review</li>
</ul>
<li>By February 16th (2 weeks before MPI Forum)</li>
<ul><li>Chapter committees collect and integrate feedback</li>
<li>Chapter committee chairs publish final chapter proposal for MPI 3.1</li>
</ul>
<li>Starting March 2nd (MPI forum meeting in Portland)</li>
<ul><li>Reading of all chapters (i.e., going through the diffs)</li>
<li>Creation of list of open issues</li>
</ul>
<li>By May 4th (4 weeks before MPI Forum)</li>
<ul><li>Chapter committees finish fixing open issues</li>
<li>Chapter committee chairs publish final chapter proposal for MPI 3.1</li>
</ul>
<li>By May 11th (3 weeks before MPI Forum)</li>
<ul><li>MPI Editor publishes final MPI 3.1 draft</li>
</ul>
<li>Starting June 1st  (MPI forum meeting in Chicago)</li>
<ul><li>Discussion of fixes to open issues</li>
<li>Final vote on document</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Voting Rules:</h2>

On March 14th 2013, the MPI forum voted for <A HREF="procedures-2013-03-15.pdf">new voting rules</a> (effective March 15th, 2013). Additionaly, there is a current proposal for a <A HREF="procedures-2015-06-proposal.pdf">new edition of this document</a>, which will be brought up for a vote at the Chicago meeting.

<h2>Document Intergration Process and Chaper Committee Responsibilities</h2>

<p>
Chapter committees will be responsible for integrating and reviewing all changes into the standard document. For already voted in tickets, errata items, and ticket 0 changes, this process can start immediately, at the latest, though, this work needs to be done between the September and December meetings. For this, one member of eacg chapter committee (the chair a designee) will have write access to the MPI 3.1 tree.
</p>

<p>
We decided to no longer use the Latex change macros for adding the new text, since those led to bad document quality (feel free to still use them for working group documents and ticket presentations - I am just talking about the main document). Instead we will rely on \"svn diff\" for change tracking. To make this work, please don't reflow any text! Also, please make sure you follow the document instructions contained in the MPI document repository (see README) to make sure we get a consistent document.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the process, every chapter committee chair is expected to provide:
<ul>
<li>A new PDF of the chapter with all changes integrated (clean document, without any change bars)</li>
<li>An SVN diff document (informal to help people track things)</li>
<li>A side document detailing the changes (tickets, errata item, ticket 0 items beyond typos, e.g., examples)</li>
</ul>
These documents need to be reviewed by the chapter committee and made available at least two weeks before the forum meeting.
</p>

<p>
A longer description of these procedures and documentation on how to write/build the MPI document is available <a href="2014-12-instructions.pdf">here</a>.
