This meeting will be held as an exceptional virtual meeting. Zoom information can be found on the
[usual page](https://github.com/mpi-forum/mpi-standard/wiki/Virtual-Forum-Meeting-Information). If that
page shows a 404 error for you, make sure you are logged into GitHub first and that you have access
to the [mpi-forum/mpi-standard](https://github.com/mpi-forum/mpi-standard) repository. If you have
not been granted access to that repository in the past, email Wesley Bland to get access.

Registration is still required to track attendance, meeting quorum, and voting eligibility. Please
click the following link to register:

Registration is being done jointly with EuroMPI 2021 and thus has some additional questions. Neither
meeting has a fee so participants are welcome to register for either or both, but registration is
still required.
