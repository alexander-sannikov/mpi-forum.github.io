This meeting will be held as an exceptional virtual meeting. Webex information can be found on the
[usual page](https://github.com/mpi-forum/mpi-standard/wiki/MPI-Forum-Webex-Information). If that
page shows a 404 error for you, make sure you are logged into GitHub first and that you have access
to the [mpi-forum/mpi-standard](https://github.com/mpi-forum/mpi-standard) repository. If you have
not been granted access to that repository in the past, email Wesley Bland to get access.

Registration is still required to track attendance, meeting quorum, and voting eligibility. You can
register [here](https://forms.gle/65bMTDiUQBmbJgjs9). If using a Google Form is not available in
your country, you can email Wesley Bland directly to register.
