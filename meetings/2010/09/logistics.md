Travel information: Best is to fly in to Stuttgart Airport (STR, which is connected to most European hubs), e.g., flying directly from US to Frankfurt, Munich or Zurich with a connecting flight to Stuttgart (e.g., with Lufthansa, or Swiss). At the airport, you can use all "S-Bahn"s in the direction to Stuttgart (with final destinations Backnang or Schorndorf) leaving every 10/20 minutes 5:08am :18, :38, :48 until 10:08pm and then every 30 min until 0:08am.

Another option is to use the only one direct USA-Stuttgart flight which is from Atlanta to Stuttgart (Delta). From Stuttgart Airport to the hotel, the best and cheapest way is the "S-Bahn (Blue Marker)", i.e., our light rail system that directly connects the airport with "Stuttgart University" station (17 minutes ride). This station is 2 minutes from the hotel (purple line) and about a 15 minutes walk from HLRS (green line). Single ticket: 2 Zones = 2.45 Euro. The ticket machines can return the change and accept also 5 Euro bills.

A third option is to fly in to Frankfurt and to use the train to come to Stuttgart "Hauptbahnhof" (main station). The main station is also directly connected with "Stuttgart University" (11 min ride). (This third option may cause trouble because of ongoing construction work at the main railway station and therefore late or missed trains to Frankfurt!)
