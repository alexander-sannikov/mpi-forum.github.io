### [Meeting Registration](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/mpi-forum-seattle-tickets-25514658029)

Advanced registration is required for this meeting. The registration covers
snacks at the meeting on Monday, Tuesday Wednesday, and Thursday lunch on
Tuesday and Wednesday, and the meeting logistics. Advanced registration is
required for this meeting so that Microsoft can process their visitor
processing procedure.

### Meeting Location

The meeting will take place at the Microsoft facility in downtown Bellevue, WA
([788 110th Ave NE, Bellevue, WA 98004, United States](https://www.google.com/maps/place/788+110th+Ave+NE,+Bellevue,+WA+98004/@47.616604,-122.1948417,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x54906c8a2a9e11c1:0x89a6ae4a28867a8e)).

Hotels downtown Bellevue are in walking distance. If you want/have to stay
further away, it is suggested that you car pool, since parking is limited. If
needed, though, there is parking available at Microsoft in a general garage.
The receptionist, who is available from 8am to 5pm only, can validate the
parking ticket.

### Hotel

We were able to secure a few rooms at a discounted rate in the Courtyard
Seattle Bellevue right across the street from the Microsoft Facility. However,
the discount block is only good Monday-Thursday. If you need to stay Sunday or
Thursday night, you will have to call Alex Sanchez at the hotel at (425)
452-0567 to get the additional night(s).
