    The Chicago Transit Authority [Blue Line train](http://www.transitchicago.com/riding_cta/systemguide/blueline.aspx) goes from the O'Hare airport (ORD) to stops just a few blocks from the Microsoft facility.

*   [Here's a map showing the complete journey from ORD to the MS facility](http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&f=d&sll=41.812267,-87.837067&sspn=0.732868,1.450195&saddr=ORD&daddr=200+E+Randolph+Dr,+60601&ttype=arr&date=&time=hh:mm&dirflg=r&ll=41.928847,-87.718964&spn=0.239586,0.620041&z=11&start=0
    ), including both the Blue Line and walking parts. The short version is that you get off the Blue Line at the Washington stop and walk about 3 blocks to the MS facility.
