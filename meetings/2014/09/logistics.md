### [Meeting Registration](http://a3.acteva.com/orderbooking/bookEvent/A340722)

Advanced registration is requested for this meeting. Due to organization and security measurements at RIKEN, registration will be required BEFORE the end of August. Later registrations cannot be accomodated. The registration cost is $50 USD.

The registration covers snacks and lunch at the meeting on Monday, Tuesday,
and Wedensday, and the meeting logistics.

### Meeting Location

The meeting will take place at [RIKEN AICS](http://www.aics.riken.jp/en/). The hotel map below shows the exact location.

### Hotel Room Block

For this meeting, no dedicated hotel block has been reserved. However, RIKEN visitors can get special rates (which may be lower than internet rates, but do not have to) at various hotels. These hotels are listed [on this map (NEW!)](http://www.sys.aics.riken.jp/Kobe-Hotels.html).

Two other hotel choices have been suggested:

*   [The B-Hotel Kobe](http://www.theb-hotels.com/the-b-kobe/en/)
*   [Daiwa Roynet Hotel Kobe Sannomiya](http://www.daiwaroynet.jp/english/kobesannomiya/)

However, other choices may exist. Here are some general tips from our host Atsushi Hori: "Sannomiya (mainland) is the busiest part of Kobe, lots of restaurants, shops, and many places to see. RIKEN AICS is located in an artificial island, there is nothing but buildings. Definitely, Sannomiya is much more fun to stay."
