### [Meeting Registration](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mpi-forum-austin-tickets-45936583558)

The registration covers snacks at the meeting on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, lunch on
Tuesday and Wednesday, and the meeting logistics. Advanced registration is always required per the
MPI Forum rules. Attendees will be required to check in and wear a guest badge on site.

### Meeting Location

The meeting will take place at the Intel office just outside of downtown Austin, TX
which is at [1300 S MoPac Expy, Austin TX 78746](https://goo.gl/maps/9qE85hgdgek). If you're using
Uber/Taxis, give them the address of the office next door to go down the frontage road instead of
the back of the building (1700 S MoPac Expy, Austin, TX 78746).

Follow the signs to the visitor parking lot. Enter from the frontage road (not by going into the
campus at the traffic light). If you go into the campus at the traffic light, you will need to leave
campus and go back around the frontage roads to get back to the visitor parking. The parking garage
is only for overflow visitor parking. Park as far in to the lot as possible.

*Do not* enter through the main entrance up the steps, but instead follow the sidewalk on the south
side of the parking lot to the double glass door. There will be a special check-in desk set up in
that lobby to make things easier for our meeting. If you end up in the wrong place, call or email
Wesley Bland (contact information will be posted around the building).

### Hotel

A hotel room block is available at [Residence Inn by Marriott Austin
Southwest](https://goo.gl/maps/XWGQmqm5hxS2) for $159.00 per night. It can be book via
[this](https://www.marriott.com/meeting-event-hotels/group-corporate-travel/groupCorp.mi?resLinkData=Intel%20MPI%20Forum%5EAUSWE%60MPIMPIA%60149.00%60USD%60false%603%606/10/18%606/15/18%606/1/18&app=resvlink&stop_mobi=yes) (expanded to include Sunday and Thursday)
link. Reservations must be made by June 1 to use this link (or you can call if you miss the deadline
and they might honor the price).

If that hotel is not available/preferable, here some other suggestions:

* [Springhill Suites by Marriott Austin South](https://goo.gl/maps/YaxEGE7eL2y)
* [Hampton Inn Austin/Airport Area South](https://goo.gl/maps/qdA7Aqz43ZF2)
* [Courtyard by Marriott Austin South](https://goo.gl/maps/MngeXUudJjT2)
* [Hampton Inn Austin/Oak Hill](https://goo.gl/maps/VVkMMVThvTK2)

All of these are suburban hotels and will have to contend with traffic. Average travel time at 9am
will probably be about 15 to 20 minutes. Downtown hotels are also available and will have less of a
traffic problem, but are much more expensive. Rental cars or taxi/rideshares will be necessary to
get to the office as there is no public transit available that will bring you to the Intel office.

### Meeting Cost

$150 (plus Eventbrite fees) per person to cover meeting logistics costs, snacks on Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday, and lunch on Tuesday and Wednesday. Â
