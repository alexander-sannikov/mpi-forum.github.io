### [Meeting Registration]()

The registration covers snacks at the meeting on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, lunch on
Tuesday and Wednesday, and the meeting logistics. Advanced registration is always required per the
MPI Forum rules. Attendees will be required to check in and wear a guest badge on site.

### Meeting Location

The meeting will take place at the Intel office just outside of downtown Austin, TX
which is at 300 S MoPac Expy, Austin TX 78746.

### Hotel

We are working to get a hotel room block, but this is a list of recommended meeting hotels:

* [Springhill Suites by Marriott Austin South](https://goo.gl/maps/YaxEGE7eL2y)
* [Hampton Inn Austin/Airport Area South](https://goo.gl/maps/qdA7Aqz43ZF2)
* [Courtyard by Marriott Austin South](https://goo.gl/maps/MngeXUudJjT2)
* [Residence Inn by Marriott Austin Southwest](https://goo.gl/maps/XWGQmqm5hxS2)
* [Hampton Inn Austin/Oak Hill](https://goo.gl/maps/VVkMMVThvTK2)

All of these are suburban hotels and will have to contend with traffic. Downtown hotels are also
available and will have less of a traffic problem, but are much more expensive. Rental cars or
taxi/rideshares will be necessary to get to the office as there is no public transit available that
will bring you to the Intel office.

### Meeting Cost

$150 (plus Eventbrite fees) per person to cover meeting logistics costs, snacks on Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday, and lunch on Tuesday and Wednesday. Â
