notes: This is the last meeting for readings of tickets intended for MPI 4.0. Any ticket read after this meeting will be in the next version of the standard! In order to ensure that we have enough time for the tickets relevant to MPI 4.0, we won't hold any WG meetings during the core times (if you want a WG meeting on Monday morning or Thursday afternoon, please contact Martin Schulz and we'll see what we can do). Further, we will give preference to tickets that have already been discussed before and are in further iterations. New tickets will only be handled time permitting.
