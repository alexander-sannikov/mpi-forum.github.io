notes: This is a virtual voting meeting, which was added to allow us to keep the timeline for MPI 4.0. The meeting will consist of plenaries only, run via Webex, and be held on the three days August 17-19, 2020 from 9am to noon US Central time, which equates to 4pm to 7pm Central European time. If we end up not needing the entire time, it may also be shorter.
