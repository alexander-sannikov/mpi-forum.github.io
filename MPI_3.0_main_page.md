## Status

The standardization of MPI 3.0 is complete and the new version of the standard is available at [MPI Forum Document Page](http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/docs.html).

#### [Implementation Status](mpi3-impl-status-Nov14.pdf), as of November 2014

### Scope

Additions to the MPI 3.0 standard that are needed for better platform and application support.  These are to be consistent with MPI being a library that provides parallel process management and data exchange capabilities.  This includes, but is not limited to, issues associated with scalability (performance and robustness), multi-core support, cluster support, and applications support.
