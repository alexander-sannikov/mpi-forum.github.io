When submitting comments, please keep in mind that the MPI Forum only deals with issues relating to the MPI standard and documents created by the MPI Forum. We cannot address issues relating to problems encountered in MPI implementations unless it deals with interpreting the MPI standard. It is especially useful to specify the document, page, and line number of the text under discussion. If you are reporting a problem with one of the documents, you may find it useful to first check the current errata documents to see if the problem is already known.
