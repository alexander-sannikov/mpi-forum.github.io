## 2019 MPI Standard Draft

The MPI Forum has published a draft version of the MPI Standard to give users and implementors a
chance to see the current status of all proposals that have been merged into the next version of the
MPI Standard. The 2019 draft was published at SC 19 and is available here:

[2019 Draft Specification](docs/drafts/mpi-2019-draft-report.pdf)

These draft specifications are not versions and are subject to change before published as an
official version of the MPI Standard.
