## 2020 MPI Standard Draft / MPI 4.0 Release Candidate

The MPI Forum has published a draft version of the MPI 4.0 Standard to give users and implementors a
chance to see the current status of all proposals that have been merged into the next version of the
MPI Standard. This draft is the release candidate for the MPI 4.0 Specification and will be
considered for ratification at the December 2020 and February 2021 meetings. The draft is available
here:

[2020 Draft Specification](docs/drafts/mpi-2020-draft-report.pdf)

Comments on the MPI 4.0 RC should be sent to the [MPI Comments mailing list](/comments).

This draft specification is not an official standard version and is subject to change before being
published as an official version of the MPI Standard.
