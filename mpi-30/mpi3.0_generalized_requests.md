### Effort Lead: George Bosilca, The University of Tennessee

### Scope:

Redefine the generalized requests interface. A more flexible interface between the user defined requests and the MPI library is required in order to allow the provider of the generalized request to integrate a progress function inside the MPI library. The ultimate goal is to allow the generalized requests progress to be done without a special test or wait function.

### Initiating Organizations:

*   The MPI Forum Steering Committee
