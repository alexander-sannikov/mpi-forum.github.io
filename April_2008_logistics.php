<h3><a name=ord>Logistics From O'Hare</a></h3>

<ul>
<li> from Airport to Downtown, the best should be BLUE-LINE train.
 Washington Station should be 7 min from Microsoft location.
 train is going each 5-10 minutes as far as I know!</li>
<li> Maybe that another station is nearer to the hotel.</li>
<li> Microsoft - hotel - distance seems to be 20 min.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chicago O'Hare International Airport is served directly by train, taxi,
shared-ride van, shuttle, and bus. The Airport Transit System provides a
quick, convenient, and free service for transfers to / from the terminals.
It can also be used to reach the long-term parking facility.
CTA Train Services I checked and you would have to change trains, take a bus
and then walk, so not a good option.</p>

<p>The Chicago Transit Authority's Blue Line provides a 24-hour service between
Chicago O'Hare International Airport and downtown Chicago. Trains run every
eight minutes from 5:00 am to 8:00 pm weekdays and every ten minutes from
5:00 am to 11:00 pm on Saturday and Sunday. The CTA station is located on
the lowest level of the main parking garage and is accessible by pedestrian
tunnels from Terminals 1, 2, and 3.</p>

<p>Taxi and Shared-ride Van Services Taxi is $35-40 one-way.</p>

<p>Taxis at Chicago O'Hare International Airport are available at all terminals
from the lower level curbfront. Metered rates apply to all destinations.
Chicago O'Hare International Airport shared-ride vans are also available at
all terminals from the lower level curbfront.</p>

<div align=center><hr width=50%></div>

<h3><a name="bus">Bus and Shuttle Service</a></h3>

<p>Located on the ground floor of the elevated parking garage, the bus /
shuttle center is the primary pickup point for hotel courtesy and Pace buses
as well as shuttles for car rental agencies and parking. The center is
accessible by tunnels from Terminals 1, 2, and 3.</p>

<p>Continental Airport Express shuttles leave Chicago O'Hare International
Airport every five to ten minutes. Tickets may be purchased at the kiosk
outside of the International Terminal and at the lower levels of Terminals
1, 2, and 3 at the counters across from the baggage claim. Continental
Airport Express also offers shuttles to northern suburban locations.</p>

<p>Continental Airport Express was recommended on several Web sites. From their
Web site: </p>

<blockquote>
Traveling From O'Hare:<br>
Shuttles depart from O'Hare airport every 10-15 minutes for downtown service
to Chicago hotels, downtown businesses, near north residential locations,
and suburban locations. Our loading zones for boarding the Airport Express
van are at Door 1E, Door 2D, and Door 3E across from baggage claim on the
Baggage Claim level. At the international terminal we are located just
outside Door 1E, which is just outside of baggage claim and Customs. The
last Airport Express van leaves O'Hare at 11:30 pm seven nights a week.
Airport Express Ticket Counters for purchasing tickets are located at Door
1E, Door 2D, and Door 3F lower level across from baggage claim on the
Baggage Claim level. RESERVATIONS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DOWNTOWN CHICAGO. We
